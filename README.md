# FlashCard-Game
Hey you all, I hope you are doing just amazing. So today as a project for my 100 Days of Code I have built a flashcard game that helps you learn French the way it was meant to be ;) You can modify this to any other language of your choice for sure with just few modifications.  Have a look around at the code and try for yourself for a couple of times and you will know how the flashcard here actually works. If you have any doubts or want to review then do connect with me. Thank you and have a great day.
